                                The BUY MUY DRUGS'Â® (taste that venom!) macrocosm is a system animal that manifests as our natural and physical world. <br/> Through an occidental lens, the current collective experience captures a subversion of normality; everything is not okay. The sway pharmaceutical monoliths have over our policy-makers and subsequently, our lives, has effected all sectors of society. This same power structure shapes the media we regard. In order to cope with post-truths and fake news, people turn to hyper-consumerism.<br/> 
                                In the age of alternative facts, we seek alternative drugs.
                                
                                The world - in which BUY MUY DRUGS exists - harbors concerted cries from all walks of life:
                                The voice of two black-market alchemists with copious amounts of gold. An arcane chairman of a multinational trap house getting high on his own supply of monoatomic gold (MFKZT, manna).
                                The working class, affected by the aftermath of MKFZT's commercial distribution, teeters in elevated levels of addiction. The gentry's license to manna-fest change enables the diet of big pharma-philosopher's stone.
                                
                                All of this, in symphony, depicts a constant theme in history: man's desire to transcend the confines of the human condition and become gods.
